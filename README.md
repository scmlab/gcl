# Guabao

This is the backend code repository of Guabao.

Guabao is a programming environment encouraging the methodology that *a program and its correctness proof should be developed hand in hand*,
and that how a program should be proved could sometimes give hints how the program can be written.

Guabao uses a variation of Edsger W. Dijkstra's [Guarded Command Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language).
However, Guabao is also an environment built into an editor.

For more info and documentation, see the [homepage](https://scmlab.github.io/guabao/).

**The Name**. GUA in Guabao comes from GUArded command language.
[Guabao (刈包)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gua_bao) is a street food popular in places including Taiwan, where Guabao the software was designed.
